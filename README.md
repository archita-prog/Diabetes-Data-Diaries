 Diabetes Data Diaries


A machine learning project exploring the Diabetes dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression.

 Overview
This project analyzes a diabetes dataset to:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and relationships.
- Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
- Apply Linear Regression for predicting diabetes progression.

 Dataset
The dataset is available on kaggle. It includes features like:
- Age
- BMI
- Blood pressure
- Glucose levels
- Insulin levels
  Dataset link - /kaggle/input/pima-indians-diabetes-database

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning & missing value analysis.
- Statistical summaries (mean, median, variance).
- Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn 
- Insights on feature distributions and relationships.

 Machine Learning Models
 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Classification
- Used to classify diabetes progression based on given features.
- Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. Linear Regression for Prediction
- Predicts continuous diabetes progression values.
- Feature importance analysis.
